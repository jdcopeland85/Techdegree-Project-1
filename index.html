          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I’m an aspiring front end web developer who loves everything about the web. I've lived in my hometown, Wytheville, Virginia, all my life. Prior to pursuing the Front End Web Development Tech Degree at Treehouse, I worked as an E-911 Dispatcher for over thirteen years.  I have always had an interest in web design and development and have self-taught myself while gaining a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  I have had the opportunity to build and maintain a few websites over the years for local small businesses, however, I am looking to sharpen and expand my skills to be an attractive asset in today's tech industry.  Ultimately, after completing the Tech Degree program, I want to transition into a career in front end web development.</p>
          <p>Currently, I am a stay-at-home dad and am a proud father to five children.  I look forward to continuing my education at Treehouse and gaining the skills and knowledge I need to be successful in the web development career field.</p>
